```

The web build will be available in the `web-build` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

#### Mobile Build

Follow the Expo documentation for creating production builds for iOS and Android:
- [Building for iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/building-standalone-apps/#build-for-ios)
